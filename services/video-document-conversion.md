col1text: Your videos aren't doing you any good sitting in storage. Move them to the
  cloud! As part of the full MultimediaSearch solution, we can convert your old videos
  in any format--reel, VHS, DVD, etc.--into digital files, complete with transcripts,
  and incorporated into your own online database.

col2text: While the media on which your video was recorded may have gone out of date,
  that doesn't mean the content of the video is no longer valuable. Let us convert
  your video into a digital format and incorporate it in your MultimediaSearch site,
  an online database and digital library. We can take it from gathering dust to fully
  indexed and searchable.

col3text: Even if your important documents are mostly printed on paper, we can make
  them fully searchable. Our enhanced scanning and character recognition technology
  preserves the original look of the document, while embedding a layer of hidden,
  fully-searchable text beneath. Combined with our decades-long experience as providers
  of database services and hosting, your old documents and videos will live on.
