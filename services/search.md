col1text: Whether your video transcripts are automatically (and imperfectly) created by YouTube, or you pay for professionally generated, highly accurate video transcriptions, their value is unlocked by making them fully searchable. MultimediaSearch does just that.
col2head: Full Text Search + Metadata = Everything
col2img: search.jpg
col2text: MultimediaSearch isn't just about full-text search, though that is a powerful tool. We also index metadata--information about the documents--that is also searchable. So, for example, you can find a document that contains a particular string of text and printed on a particular date. The only limit to the metadata we can index is the information you can provide us.

col3text: Typically, the only way to navigate online videos is by clicking the timing bar at the bottom of a video player. But this is inefficient. With fully indexed searchable transcripts, users can search their way into a video and even skip to the content they're interested in by clicking the transcript.
