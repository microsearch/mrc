<h3>From Paper Documents to Online Collection</h3>

  Even if your important documents are mostly printed on paper or your videos are on VHS, we can make them fully searchable. For documents, our enhanced scanning and character recognition technology preserves the original look of the document, while embedding a layer of hidden, fully-searchable text beneath. For videos, we can make a digital version of your tapes, transcribe any spoken text, and provide a fully searchable transcript. Have a mix of documents and videos? No problem! We can combine them into one online MultimediaSearch database. <a href="/services/video-document-conversion/">Learn more...</a>

  Moving to the cloud is a great idea for any organization of any size, but we think that once you're on the cloud, you're only half way there. We are a search company. For nearly two decades we've been helping clients gain faster, more efficient access to their information. At first, that information was on CD-ROMS, then Web 1.0 document databases, and today we're proud to offer full-text search solutions for documents <i>and</i> videos hosted in the cloud. <a href="/services/search/">Learn more...</a>

  You have a YouTube Channel or Vimeo Page--plenty of videos, but not a lot of viewers. MultimediaSearch can help. We provide transcripts for all your videos, index them, and make them fully searchable. Then, we collect your videos into your own MultimediaSearch library and embed it on your website. Viewers can search, find, watch, and share your videos without leaving your page. <a href="/services/seo/">Learn more...</a>
