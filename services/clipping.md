col2text: We all know how a highlighter works; you're reading on paper when suddenly
  a few words or a sentence jumps off the page at you and you just have to mark it
  and save it for later. Imagine being able to highlight a line in an online video
  and then email it to yourself or others or share it on social media. MultimediaSearch
  brings the trusty highlighter into the twenty-first century.

col3text: Imagine you're watching a video online and there's a part somewhere in the
  middle of the video that you want your friends or followers to see. But how to direct
  them to that exact moment in the video? You could tell them to jump to a certain
  point in time, or, with MultimediaSearch, you could highlight just the clip you
  want to share and a link will be automatically created that will take them to the
  exact moment your clip begins. Revolutionary, right?
