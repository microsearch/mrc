pagebox1text: Even if your important documents are mostly printed on paper or your
  videos are on VHS or DVD, we can make them fully searchable. For documents, our
  enhanced scanning and character recognition technology preserves the original look
  of the document, while embedding a layer of hidden, fully-searchable text beneath.
  For videos, we can make a digital version of your tapes, transcribe any spoken text,
  and provide a fully searchable transcript. Have a mix of documents and videos? No
  problem! We can combine them into one online MultimediaSearch database. <a href="/services/video-document-conversion/">Learn
