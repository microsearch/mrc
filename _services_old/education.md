  of videos, from news items to lectures. That means your video content is spread
  across the web, not housed where it should be, on your website. Centralize your
  video content. Your students will thank you.

  of media can feel like a full time job. Thatâ€™s where we come in. VideoSearchfrom
  Microsearch lets you collect all your videos into one searchable library and publish

  abound.
