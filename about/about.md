Multimedia Reference Corporation is a non-profit corporation 501(c)(3) that helps academic organizations provide unparalleled online access to their documents and videos, enabling a more efficient online learning experience for students and researchers.
**Collect** your content, and allow users to **Browse** using metadata and **Search** every word in your collection.

We partner with [MicroSearch Corporation](http://www.microsearch.net) a search engine company that provides video and document search engine services for client organizations across the country through hosted portal solutions.

Building on MicroSearch's platform, we convert client video transcripts and documents into searchable digital libraries, and host that digital content online in secure web portals.

A hosted client digital library may contain thousands or even hundreds of thousands of video transcripts or documents, together with all of the related metadata, and all are readily accessible on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktop computers.

Each client digital library is hosted in a web portal; the web portal may be private and secure, or it may be open and public. Public libraries, for instance, use public web portals, while Research Associations generally have private, secure web portals. Each of our client web portals is highly customized to give each client exactly the search & retrieval experience desired.
